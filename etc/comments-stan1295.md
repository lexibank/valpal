#### General comment

Concerning the frequency of a verb's alternation, we decided intuitively whether
an alternation occurs 'marginally' or 'regularly'. Some alternations marked as
occuring 'marginally' surely have to be rediscussed.

Concerning the Coding Frames we did not pay attention to adjuncts.

Often there can be created alternations of alternations. We did not mark them but in most cases we made a comment.
We did not establish a causative alternation.
