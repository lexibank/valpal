#### General comment

RE: Ommission of reflexive pronouns<br>
Ket verbs regularly omit the object NP verb externally and also omit the
verb-external reflexive pronoun, but the verb-internal marker that indexes this
valent is never dropped for discourse reasons.

RE: Object omission (NP ommission)<br>
Ket regularly drops its verb-external object NP to background it in discourse.
However, the verb-internal object marker remains regardless of discourse
function.
