#### General comment

 * Language family: Afro Asiatic > Semitic > Centralsemitic > Arabic
 * National language in 26 states
 * In all Arabic speaking communities there is a Diglossical situation with three varieties of Arabic:
   1. Arabic Vernaculars - varieties of Arabic dialects, learned as a native language
   2. Classical Arabic (CA) - the language of the Quran used in liturgical acts
   3. Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) - used as lingua franca in interdialectical comunication, in media, education, street-signs, etc.; acquired as L2 through education

#### Characterization of flagging resources

 * MSA is an accusative language and has a three-case system:<br>
   nominative, genitive and accusative.
 * Prepositions govern the genitive in Arabic; this feature isn't displayed in the coding frames in the database:<br>
   e.g.: V.subj[E] E-nom min+M<br>
   not: V.subj[E] E-nom min+M-gen

#### Characterization of indexing resources

 * only subject agreement is marked on the verb.
 * in the basic word order VSO there is a subject-verb agreement in person and gender not in number. If the subject precedes the verb there has to be a full agreement i.e. in person, gender and number.
 * subject NPs can be omitted.
 * pronominal object is expressed by a suffix on the verb

#### Characterization of ordering resources

MSA is a VSO language with no fixed word order.
