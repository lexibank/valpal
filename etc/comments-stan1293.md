#### General comment

In general the task presented by English is different in many ways from that
faced by most other contributors, mainly on account of the vast body of existing
research on valency patterns on English but also on account of the unparalleled
resources available for English, including very large corpora and the
English-language internet.

#### Source of the data and generalizations/background of the contributor(s)

I have generally constructed what seem to me to be typical-sounding sentences.
In many cases I've checked on the internet or in Cobuld Wordbanks Online that
the examples are indeed "ordinary" in character, but I haven't restricted myself
at this stage to using all and only corpus-documented examples.
