46,Language contribution,A language contribution to ValPaL is a separtely citable online publication that has the same status as a chapter in an edited book.,<BR>,"Verb meaning, Verb form"
47,Verb meaning,The 80 ValPaL verb meanings are comparison meanings that were chosen for representativeness and comparability.,"The purpose of the Valency Database Questionnaire is to gather comparable valency data on a wide variety of languages. The data will be comparable because the verbs are elicited in response to a list of 70 pre-defined verb meanings, and because the valency information is recorded in a standard way. The 70 verb meanings are described in Table 1, in three columns: (i) the meaning label, (ii) the role frame, and (iii) a typical context. (Since the English verbs used as meaning labels sometimes have different meanings, we have added a sentence for each verb meaning that makes the intended meaning clear. These sentences are not crucial, they are just intended to help the contributors find a context for a counterpart.)<BR><BR>This sample of 70 verbs, which was in part selected on the basis of the feedback from the contributors, is hoped to be representative of the verbal lexicon. It is in particular these verb meanings that have been reported to show distinctive grammatical behaviour in the literature. Of course the editors had to try to strike a balance between a temptation to include more interesting verb meanings in the list, and avoiding overload on the part of contributors if confronted with a more extensive list. Further interesting verbs could be added to the database of individual languages.",Meaning label
48,Verb form,The citation form of a verb that is the counterpart of a ValPaL verb meaning.,"Please find a counterpart verb in your language for each of the pre-defined verb meanings. Note that the meaning definition is given by the role frame (plus optional comments in the meaning comments field, and example), not by the meaning label (COVER, FILL, etc.). The latter is only a label that serves as a heading for the record. The meaning thus includes information about semantic roles, for which the role frame is crucial (e.g. the meaning intended by WASH is 'A washes P', not 'A washes').<BR>For each verb meaning of the database, please find the semantically most fitting non-derived verb in the project language. More generally, the verb should have a &quot;basic&quot; flavour, i.e. verbs that are used very rarely should be avoided if a more commonly verb with similar meaning is available. &ldquo;Basic&rdquo;ness of the counterpart verbs is more important than exact semantic equivalence between the pre-defined meanings and the counterparts. The only requirement is that the correspondence is close enough to be helpful for the project.<BR>The relationship between pre-defined meanings and counterpart verbs is many to many. This means that if there are two basic verbs in your language that correspond to a meaning, you should include them both, and if a single verb corresponds to two different meanings, it needs to be given only once.<BR>If there is no counterpart in your language and a paraphrase would have to be used (e.g. if HIDE is expressed as 'put something somewhere where others cannot see it'), please do not give a counterpart. (This means checking the field &quot;No counterpart&quot; in the Meanings layout.)<BR>This does not mean that verbs that are complex in some way should be excluded. If a complex verbal expression, whether a morphologically derived form or a syntactic phrase, is conventional (or lexicalized), it should be included, even if it is productively derived.3 Thus, complex precicates like English carry out or German teil-nehmen 'take part', as well as serial-verb complexes like Yoruba b&aacute; ... w&iacute; 'rebuke', should be regarded as single verbs.<BR>If a verb has other meanings than the pre-defined meaning for which it is a counterpart, it is helpful to include these other meanings, in the comments field.4 (It is also possible to create new meanings; see &sect;9.3 below for this advanced feature.)<BR>Homonymous verbs should be distinguished by a number, e.g. lie (1) ('be in a horizontal position') and lie (2) ('say something that is untrue').<BR>The &quot;comments&quot; field can contain further non-structured information about all aspects of the verb and its relationship to the pre-defined meaning.<BR>",
49,Coding frame,"The coding frame of a verb contains the information about the way its arguments are coded, either flagged (by adpositions and case-markers on the arguments) or indexed (by person-markers on the verb).","In our terminology, the valency of a verb is the list of its arguments with their coding properties (coding frame), their behavioural properties (syntactic-function frame), and with the relationship of the arguments to the roles in the verb's role frame.<BR>Coding properties involve the following techniques (Haspelmath 2005; Malchukov, Haspelmath &amp; Comrie 2010):<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;flagging (case or adposition marking)<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;indexing (agreement, cross-referencing)<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;word order (in the absence of other kinds of marking)<BR>Behavioural properties concern the behaviour with respect to patterns like reflexivization, passivization, causativization, argument omission, and various cross-clausal constructions such as control, switch-reference, raising and coordination. As a verb's valency consists of both the coding properties and the behavioural properties of its arguments, all these are in principle relevant to valency. However, in the Leipzig Valency Classes Project, only coding properties and one aspect of the behavioural properties, alternations, are taken into account.<BR>An example of a full specification of a verb's valency is given below for English remind:<BR>English remind&nbsp;<BR>coding frame:&nbsp;<BR>A &gt; V.subj[A] &gt; R &gt; of+T<BR>syntactic-function frame:<BR>subjectX direct.objectY oblique.objectZ<BR>role frame:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>A reminds R of T (or: agentA addresseeR themeT<BR>or: A cause (remember R T))<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&ndash; The coding frame contains information about flagging (e.g. the preposition of), indexing (e.g. the fact that the verb agrees with the subject), and word order.<BR>&ndash; The syntactic-function frame contains information about behavioural properties, summed up in syntactic-function labels (thus, &quot;subject&quot; means that the argument controls verb-indexing, can undergo raising, becomes the oblique agent in passivization, etc.). Although it is part of valency, the syntactic-function frame as such plays no role in this project, and we limit ourselves to considering the behaviour of verbs in alternations.<BR>&ndash; The role frame tells us how the syntactic arguments map onto semantic roles (this can be done in various ways, by simple English glosses with participant variables, by informative semantic-role labels, or by semantic decomposition with participant variables).<BR>An argument of a verb is a phrase whose occurrence is made possible by a specific verb, and which therefore cannot occur with a generic verb. This can be tested by attempting to move a phrase into a neighboring clause with an anaphoric verb, as shown in (1a, 1c). Adjuncts, by contrast, are not tied to particular verbs and can therefore be moved out into a clause with an anaphoric verb (1b, 1d):<BR>(1)&nbsp;<BR>&#9;a.&#9;I wrote a letter. &gt; *I wrote, and I did a letter.<BR>&#9;b.&#9;I wrote with a pen. &gt; I wrote, and I did it with a pen.<BR>&#9;c.&#9;I put the book on the table. <BR>&nbsp;*I put the book, and this happened on the table.<BR>&#9;d.&#9;I wrote the letter on the table. &gt; <BR>I wrote the letter, and this happened on the table.<BR>If you are unsure whether a participant is an argument or an adjunct, please make an arbitrary choice and include a comment in the verb layout's comment field. (Please do not use language-specific criteria for &quot;argumenthood&quot;, because these are really criteria for different concepts labeled &quot;argument&quot;, not for comparable 'argument' concepts.)<BR>Different verbs have different coding frames, but in all languages, coding frames recur, e.g. in German, the sample coding frames shown in (2a-c) occur in many different verbs:<BR>(2)<BR>&#9;a.&#9;A-nom X-dat:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>(helfen 'A helps X', folgen 'A follows X', dienen 'A serves X', ...)<BR>&#9;b.&#9;S-nom an+X:<BR>(denken 'S thinks of X', liegen 'S is due to X', etc.)<BR>&#9;c.&#9;A-nom R-acc an+T:<BR>(erinnern 'A reminds R of T', etc.)<BR>(Note: capital letters other than V are used as argument/participant variables.6)<BR>Since coding frames are not unique, but recur, they are in a separate table of the database. Once a coding frame has been set up for a verb, all other verbs using the same coding frame can make use of the same record, i.e. coding frames need to be entered only once and can thereafter be simply selected from the list of existing coding frames.<BR>A coding frame is a list of all the argument variables with their standard coding, i.e. flagging (case-marking or adposition marking), indexing (&quot;agreement&quot; or &quot;cross-referencing&quot;), possibly word order, plus a verb variable.<BR>The following conventions are used:<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;cases: case labels are attached to an argument variable by a hyphen, e.g. A-nom (for nominative case), R-dat, P-abs<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;adpositions: forms of adpositions are attached to an argument variable by a plus sign, e.g. for+X, &agrave;+R<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;indices: index labels are attached to the verb variable by a period, e.g. V.subj[A] (for German subject agreement), subj[A].obj[P].V (for Bantu subject and object agreement); the role information is given in brackets<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;noun incorporation: is marked by angle brackets, e.g. A P &lt;I&gt;V<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;word order: if the order of elements is fairly fixed and potentially distinctive,7 an greater-than character (&gt;) is used between elements that occur adjacent and normally in the given order (e.g. English A &gt; V.subj[A] &gt; P)<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;optionality: If a coding element occurs optionally or variably (i.e. only under some circumstances), it can be put in parentheses8<BR>Note that case labels and index labels are language-specific entities, just like adpositions. There is no need to standardize (or abbreviate) them, because they will eventually have to be defined in full detail anyway (but not within our database). Transparent labels are good for mnemonic reasons, though. If word order is not consistent or particularly distinctive, the order in which the argument variables and the verb variable occur in the coding frame is in principle arbitrary, but for mnemonic reasons, an order that corresponds to the most frequent clause order is advisable.<BR>It is important to note that the coding frame descriptions are necessarily schematic and partial and cannot possibly describe the coding fully. For example, if an index can either be a prefix or a suffix, then a salient or dominant position should be chosen, without worrying about the incompleteness of the coding frame. Another example is word order, which often obeys complex regularities that cannot possibly be captured by simple schemas.<BR>In most cases, arguments are noun phrases or adpositional phrases with specific coding. However, arguments may also be adverbial arguments, in particular locational arguments. These arguments do not have any specific coding, cf. (3). In such cases, all we can say is that the argument is a locational phrase of some sort, and the coding frame is &quot;A V T LOC&quot;.<BR>(3)&nbsp;<BR>&#9;a.&#9;Put the book on the shelf<BR>&#9;b.&#9;Put the money under the mattress.<BR>&#9;c.&#9;Put it here.<BR>Whether the arguments are obligatory or optional is not recorded in the coding frames, because it may depend on too many different factors, most of which have nothing to do with the verb-specific coding. If an argument can be omitted only with certain verbs, then this should be regarded as an argument-omission alternation (e.g. object omission with existenitial/generic meaning that is possible for objects of certain verbs in English: He often reads/eats/drinks).<BR>If a verb is associated with several different coding frames that are not related by a regular alternation, then the verb has to be split up (somewhat artificially) into two different homonymous verbs. (In reality, the relationship between verbs and coding frames is many-to-many, but we simplify our database structure by pretending that it is many-to-one.)<BR>The contributors indicate the semantic roles of the arguments by using the same variables as argument variables that are used as participant variables in the role frames of the pre-defined meanings, for instance:<BR>pre-defined meaning label:<BR>ASK FOR<BR>pre-defined role frame:<BR>'A asks R for T'<BR>German counterpart verb:<BR>bitten<BR>coding frame:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>A-nom V R-acc um+T<BR><BR>In this way, it becomes clear that the nominative argument has the asker role, the accusative argument has the askee role, and the complement of the preposition um has the role of thing asked for.<BR>It is important to be aware that the semantic roles in the role frames do not necessarily correspond to syntactic arguments in your language. (The role frames are not &quot;semantic valency frames&quot;, and we do not work with a semantic definition of arguments.) The role frames are intended to convey the verb's meaning and to provide readily identifiable participant variables, not to prejudge the number of syntactic arguments that a counterpart verb will have.<BR>Note that in the role frames, some arguments are given in parentheses. This has no particular meaning, but is intended to draw attention to the fact that we do not expect all roles to correspond to arguments of the counterpart verb of your language. The roles in parentheses seem to us particularly likely not to correspond to arguments, but this is just an expectation based on our impressions. What counts are the facts of your language.<BR>If your verb is associated with two coding frames that are related via an uncoded alternation (e.g. English give, which can have the coding frame &quot;A &gt; V &gt; R &gt; T&quot; or the coding frame &quot;A &gt; V &gt; T &gt; to+R&quot;), the decision of which coding frame to take as basic may not be possible on a principled basis, so an arbitrary decision may have to be taken.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your verb has an argument with a semantic role that is not included in the role frame, please use additional role variables and characterize the additional roles in the comment field of the coding verb.<BR><BR>",
50,Alternation,"A valency alternation is defined as a set of two different coding frames that are productively (or at least regularly) associated with both members of a set of verb pairs sharing the same verb stem. Alternations may be coded (marked by an affix on the verb, or by an auxiliary, like the English Passive) or uncoded (like the English Dative alternation).","For the purposes of our project, a valency alternation is defined as a set of two different coding frames that are productively (or at least regularly) associated with both members of a set of verb pairs sharing the same verb stem. (Thus, we are restricting ourselves to coding alternations.) Valency alternations may or may not be coded in the verb form, and accordingly we distinguish two types of alternations, uncoded alternations (such as the English Dative Shift alternation) and coded alternations (such as the English Passive alternation).<BR>Examples of alternations are the following:<BR>English:<BR>Dative Shift (uncoded)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>A &gt; V &gt; R &gt; T<BR>&lt;&gt;<BR>A &gt; V &gt; T &gt; to+R<BR>(e.g. give, sell, lend, ...)<BR><BR>Russian:<BR>Anticausative alternation (coded)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>A-nom V X-acc<BR>&lt;&gt;<BR>X-nom V-sja<BR>(e.g. lomat' 'break', otkryt', 'open', ...)<BR><BR>German:<BR>Passive Voice (coded)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>A-nom X-acc V<BR>&lt;&gt;<BR>X-nom von+A V-t+werden<BR>(e.g. nehmen, bringen, schicken, lachen, ...)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Alternations are relevant to the project to the extent they are sensitive to verb classification (e.g., some varieties of differential object marking apply to any transitive verb, which does not yield an interesting clustering of verb types). More generally for our purposes, most relevant are those alternations which are fairly productive (not restricted to a few lexical items), but &shy;&ndash; most importantly &ndash; are sensitive to lexical classes. That is, we are interested in alternations which are distinctive for the verbal lexicon (as sampled here) rather than in those which apply across the board or apply to just few items.<BR>One of the alternants needs to be designated as &quot;basic&quot; for the purposes of the database. In a coded alternation, this will be the alternant with no coding on the verb. In an uncoded alternation (as well as in a doubly coded alternation), the contributor has to choose one alternant as &quot;basic&quot;. It is understood that a principled decision will often be difficult or impossible, so an arbitrary decision can be taken.<BR>Contributors will ideally enter all (major) valency alternations of their language into the &quot;alternations&quot; table of the database, but if there are more than ten such alternations, then this will be a lot of work, and they should contact the editors.<BR>Then for each verb, they will have to decide whether the verb occurs in the alternation or not, or whether it applies only marginally.<BR><BR>Examples of uncoded alternations<BR>In this subsection only uncoded alternations are considered; discussion of coded alternations is postponed to the next subsection. The two subsections should be seen as largely complementary, as alternations will be coded by dedicated markers in some languages (apparently especially languages with a richer morphology) and left uncoded in other languages (like English).<BR>We begin with English, a rather atypical example of a language with a particularly rich set of uncoded alternations. Levin (1993) mentions, in particular, the following alternations. (The list below mentions only fairly productive alternations and does not include verb-coded alternations like the passive alternation; the terminology partially differs from Levin's.)<BR>&#9;a.&#9;the Ambitransitive Alternation (John broke the stick ~ The stick broke)<BR>&#9;b.&#9;the Middle Alternation (John cut the bread ~ The bread cuts easily)<BR>&#9;c.&#9;the Reflexive Omission Alternation (John washed himself ~ John washed)<BR>&#9;d.&#9;the Reciprocal Alternation (John married Mary ~ John and Mary married)<BR>&#9;e.&#9;the Dative Alternation (Mary gave the book to John ~&nbsp; gave John the book)<BR>&#9;f.&#9;the Locative Alternation (John loaded the truck with hay ~ the hay onto the truck)<BR>&#9;g.&#9;the Conative Alternation (John cut the bread ~ cut at the bread)<BR>&#9;h.&#9;the Object Omission Alternation (John ate the bread ~ John ate).<BR><BR>Examples of coded alternations<BR>Languages with richer morphology often use coded alternations for many argument alternations left uncoded in English. Thus in Even, a Tungusic language, the &ldquo;middle alternation&rdquo; is signaled by the mediopassive marker, the &ldquo;inchoative-causative alternation&rdquo; is signaled by the causative marker (in competition with the mediopassive), while equivalents of English verbs allowing for a &ldquo;reciprocal alternation&rdquo; commonly involve a lexicalized sociative marker (e.g. baka-lda [find-SOC] &lsquo;meet&rsquo;).<BR>One can use taxonomy for the domain of verb-coded alternations, as we adopted for (uncoded) coding alternations:<BR>&ndash; Valency-reducing alternations, coming in several subtypes:<BR>&#9;a.&#9;Subject-demoting/deleting alternations<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;anticausative<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;middle<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;reflexive<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;reciprocal<BR>&#9;b.&#9;Object-demoting/deleting alternations<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;antipassive<BR>&#9;c.&#9;Subject-Object rearranging alternations<BR>&#9;&bull;&#9;passive (differs from anticausative in that A may be expressed, or is implied)<BR>&ndash;&nbsp; Valency-increasing and valency-rearranging alternations, especially causatives and applicatives; the latter however may rearrange rather than increase the valency. In some languages, the same marker is used both in causative and applicative functions; also for such cases it is important to determine which verbs select for which function.<BR>Note that some languages have several causative markers, for example, for building intransitive vs. transitive causatives. These can be used to test for transitivity of less prototypical transitive verbs.<BR>There may be several subtypes of applicatives, depending on which object is promoted (for example, in Hooca&#808;k (Siouan), there are 4 different applicative markers, including the benefactive applicative, the instrumental applicative and two types of locative applicatives). On the other hand, the general applicative in Salish has been claimed to have different meanings depending on the verb&rsquo;s class. Applicatives may be used to render many of the alternations listed in &sect;8.2, including the dative shift, or locative alternation (cf. (f)).&nbsp; Other languages may use directional markers to code some of these alternations (cf.&nbsp; Russian na-gruzit&rsquo; seno na telegu [PREF-load hay on cart] &lsquo;to load the hay on the cart&rsquo; vs. za-gruzit&rsquo; telegu senom [PREF-load cart hay.INS] &lsquo;to load the cart with hay&rsquo;; German laden vs. be-laden).<BR>Not all alternations can be easily classified as valency-increasing/rearranging or valency-reducing. For example, some (Austronesian) languages show a variety of &ldquo;voice&rdquo; (or &ldquo;focus&rdquo;)&nbsp; forms (&ldquo;actor focus&rdquo;, &ldquo;goal focus&rdquo;, etc), used for &lsquo;promotion&rsquo; of different objects to the subject position; for these languages it will be relevant which Vs allow for which voice constructions. On the other hand, head-marking languages of the &ldquo;hierarchical type&rdquo; show a direct-inverse alternation triggered by the relative prominence of the A and P arguments. In that case it is relevant to study the use of direct-inverse alternations with different groups of two and three argument verbs (in the latter case, it is also relevant which of the object arguments takes part in the alternation; e.g., Theme or Recipient of a ditransitive verb). But also for the domain of monotransitives some languages may show further differentiation; e.g., some languages (like Tlapanec) may have different inverse forms for different subtypes of 2-argument verbs.<BR>",
51,Argument type,"Arguments are classified into cross-linguistic argument types: A (argument coded like the 'breaker' of 'break'), P (argument coded like the 'broken thing' of 'break'), S (sole argument of a verb that lacks A and P), I (argument coded like the instrument of 'cut'), L (coded like the sitting location of 'sit'), and X (all others).",X,
