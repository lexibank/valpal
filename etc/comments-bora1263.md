#### General comment

any noun phrase (argument or adjunct) is always optional (except for subjects
with some forms of verbal predicates). It was not possible to apply a test using
the sentence frame suggested in the manual to distinguish between arguments and
adjuncts. The Bora coding frames given here include all arguments/adjuncts of
the pre-defined role frame with the corresponding Bora case marking.

The database includes as coded alternations causative, reflexive and reciprocal
derivation, which are all productive. There is a separate derivational system,
which is relatively unproductive, which combines transitivity marking and verbal
number marking (see examples under SIT). These alternations are not taken into
account in this database.

#### Characterization of flagging resources

the major resource for argument/adjunct identification is case marking which
applies regularly to all noun phrases except that accusative case is marked only
on animates (-ke), unmarked for inanimates

#### Characterization of indexing resources

subjects may be cross-referenced by suffixes on the verb

#### Characterization of ordering resources

word order is not a resource for argument identification, as it is mostly free
except for some restricions on subjects: first and second person subject
pronouns procliticize to the verb, some forms of predicates require overt
subject noun phrases that precede the verb. If in such a construction a

#### Source of the data and generalizations/background of the contributor(s)

Data marked as "elicited from native speaker" was elicited by Frank Seifart
during field work in Peru in April 2010 and by telephone in March 2011.
Applicability of alternations was also elicited on these two occasions.
