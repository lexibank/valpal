hokk1249,Hokkaido Japanese,hokk1249,Hokkaidō,,Papunesia,43.691708,142.866211,Japonic,Kan Sasaki,Asia,"<SPAN STYLE= """" >Brief description of the Hokkaido dialect of Japanese<BR><BR>In this database, the Hokkaido dialect is used to refer to the variety of Japanese spoken in the northern island Hokkaido and the islands around Hokkaido. According to Ono &amp; Okuda (1999), Japanese speakers begin to settle on the coastal area of southern Hokkaido from the late 16th century. Most of the population in those days came from the northern Tohoku region. From the mid 19th century to mid 20th century, intensive immigration to Hokkaido took place from all the part of Japan. However, in this case, too, the majority (around 40%) came from Tohoku (Ono &amp; Okuda 1999). Consequently, the Hokkaido Dialect has inherited a considerable number of features from the northern Tohoku dialects.<BR>&#9;The Hokkaido dialect has no written tradition, but some sentences reflecting this dialect appear in the modern Japanese literature. The most famous example is the conversational part of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >Kanikosen</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'The Crab Canning Ship' written by Takiji Kobayashi in 1929. <BR>&#9;The population of Hokkaido is 5,502,944 (June 30th, 2011). However, the exact number of speakers of the Hokkaido dialect is unknown.<BR>&#9;The Hokkaido dialect is classified as one of the eastern varieties of Japanese dialects and it is subdivided into the coastal variety and the inland variety. The coastal variety preserves lots of characteristics of the Tohoku dialects, such as the imperative use of the conditional inflection, neutralization of /i/ and /e/, intervocalic voicing of /k/ and /t/, spotaneous voice morphology with /rasar/, and so on. Certain inland dialects are reported to preserve some degree of dialectal features of their region of origin (Suga 2011). For example, the dialect spoken in Hombetsu (Nakagawa district, Tokachi) has the copula </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >ja/zja</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >, found in the Tokushima dialect spoken in the Shikoku island. According to Ishigaki (1976), the inland variety underwent influence from the coastal variety, even though the origin of the population is not the same as that of the coastal variety. The most important grammatical feature of the Hokkaido dialect for this database is the existence of anticausativization with /rasar/ suffixation. This grammatical phenomenon is found in both varieties.<BR>&#9;The most notable feature of this dialect is the voice system. Standard Japanese has three productive voice suffixes, i.e., passive, potential and causative. On the other hand, the Hokkaido dialect has four productive voice suffixes: passive /rare/ (traditionally, /rae/), potential /e/ or /rare/ (traditionally, /-ni i:/), causative /sase/ (traditionally, /rase/ or /rahe/) and spontaneous /rasar/. The spontaneous suffix /rasar/ is used as a marker for anticausativization. For the details of anticausativization in the Hokkaido dialect, see Sasaki &amp; Yamazaki (2006).<BR>&#9;Due to the existence of productive antucausative morphology, the Hokkaido dialect displays different characteristics of the transitivity alternation from that of Standard Japanese. Concerning transitivization, both Standard Japanese and the Hokkaido dialect have lexical and morphological causativization. For example, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >ak-u</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >  'open.INTR-NPST' -- </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >ake-ru</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'open.TR-NPST' and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >hasir-u</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'run-NPST' -- </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >hasir-ase-ru</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'run-CAUS-NPST'. On the other hand, concerning intransitivization, they show difference. Standard Japanese has only lexical anticausativization, such as </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >or-u</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'break.TR-NPST' -- </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >ore-ru</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'break.INTR-NPST'.

However, anticausativization remains active in his speech.</SPAN>"

Many varieties exist also outside the peninsula, reaching from Northern China far out to Central Asia. This database shows valency properties of Modern South Korean (henceforth Korean, see also discussion below) which is based on the dialect of Seoul (see Song 2012), although contrary to standard sources such as Sohn (1999), an emphasis has been put on what is commonly used in spoken usage.<BR><BR>Korean is an agglutinating language with a basic word order often stated as SOV, although it may be flexible depending on information structure and discourse factors. Word order may become less flexible as soon as case markers are dropped, and whenever there are double nominative or double accusative constructions (see comments on ordering resources though).<BR><BR>The genetic affiliation of Korean is notoriously disputed, with three different main stances on this: The first stance is that Korean is an Altaic language (Lee 2008), the second that it might be distantly related to Japanese (Lee and Ramsey 2000), and the third that it is simply a language isolate (Sohn 1999). Especially the latter suggestion is highly misleading:<BR><BR>Firstly, monographs such as Lee and Ramsey 2000 explain that it is probable that multiple related languages were spoken by ancient kingdoms, and probably the language of Shilla gave rise to what is now considered Korean. However, data seems to be scarce and not much can be said about the different languages spoken on the Korean peninsula during that period.<BR><BR>Secondly, a huge deal of socio-politically motivated language ideology is obvious, yet far too often overlooked in Korean linguistics (and beyond), and it is curious that with 'Korean' we almost always refer to Modern Standard South Korean. Prescriptive movements and over-standardisation (see Park 2010) seems to be a popular sociolinguistic practice fed by nationalism and high pride of one's own language. As a consequence, regional variation is commonly downplayed within Korean linguistics, and as a result, material on variation of Korean covers relatively few linguistic areas and is generally very dense (see King 2006, for example).<BR><BR>The past years have seen an ongoing change of perception, at least in non-capital parts of Korea as well as international linguistics. Although not widely acknowledged yet, Jeju spoken in Jeju Province has been classified as a critically endangered language (Moseley 2010), and renowned figures in the field of endangered languages and Korean linguistics (Matthias Brenzinger, p.c. and William O'Grady, p.c.) support the view that Korean is only a language isolate by ideology, but not by empirical fact, since it should more appropriately seen as constituting a small Koreanic language family of at least two languages (see Kang 2007 for a rough sketch of Korean's little sister language Jeju). </SPAN>"

This area is 50km north to Tokyo, the capital of Japan. In spite of its close location to the economic and cultural center of Japan, the dialect spoken in this area displays phonological and morphosyntactic characteristics different from Standard Japanese.<BR>&#9;This dialect is classified as one of the eastern varieties of Japanese dialect. As mentioned below, this dialect shows Tohoku-like characteristics and Kanto-like characteristics simultaneously in both phonology and morphosyntax. This Janus-faced characteristic is a reflection of the geographical situation, i.e., the southern edge of Tohoku dialects.<BR>&#9;The population of Joso city is 64,880 (August 16th, 2011). Due to its low inflow of population, most of the population can be regarded as a speaker of the Mitsukaido dialect. The old generation preserves the classic type of grammatical traits, while the speech of the younger generation undergoes influence from Standard Japanese. Sasaki (2011) illustrates that the loss of dialectal features in younger generation is overwhelming but not complete. <BR>&#9;This dialect has no written tradition, but some sentences reflecting the grammatical traits of this dialect are found in the modern Japanese literature. The most well-known case is the conversational part of the novel </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >Tsuchi</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'The Earth' written by Takashi Nagatsuka in 1910.<BR>&#9;The data used in this article is obtained from speakers aged over 80 and these data reflect traditional features.<BR>&#9;The phonemic inventory of this dialect is the same as that of Standard Japanese. This dialect has five vowel phonemes /i, e, a, o, u/ and 11 consonant phonemes /p, t, k, b, d, g, n, m, r, w, j/. The dialect lacks lexical accent.<BR>&#9;Despite of its phonemic affinity with Standard Japanese, the surface phonetic realization of cognate words is different from that of Standard Japanese because of the phonological processes not found in Standard Japanese: 'breath' is [iki] in SJ and [egi] in MD; 'square floor cushion' is [dzabutoN] in SJ and [dzaptoN] in MD. Most of the phonological processes responsible for the surface difference are those also found in Tohoku dialects, for example, intervocalic voicing of stops, regressive devoicing of /z/ and /b/, lowering of /i/ without onset, and so on. The phonological processes interact in a complex manner. Some interactions exhibit multiple opaque interactions. For the details of the interaction of phonological processes, see Sasaki (2008a). In order to avoid confusion, I adopt systematic allophones, i.e., the output of the phonological processes, as notation in this database ([ng] stands for velar nasal). <BR>&#9;Concerning the morphology relating to valency alternation, both affinity and difference are found between the Mitsukaido dialect and Standard Japanese. The voice system of the Mitsukaido dialect is almost the same as that of Standard Japanese, i.e., both the Mitsukaido dialect and Standard Japanese have productive passive, causative and potential formation, but lack productive anticausativization widely attested in the Tohoku dialects, though the phonological shape of the morphemes is not completely the same: the passive and the potential suffixes are identical to those of Standard Japanese, namely passive /rare/ and potential /e/ and /rare/, while the causative suffix is /sase/ in Standard Japanese but /rase/ in the Mitsukaido dialect. <BR>&#9;The difference between the Mitsukaido dialect and Standard Japanese is most prominent with respect to the case system. The case alignment of subject and direct object in the Mitsukaido dialect is accusative type, as in Standard Japanese. However, the morphological shapes of nominative and accusative are different. Nominative is expressed by zero-marking (in Standard Japanese, the case particle -</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >ga</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > is used). Accusative case form is different depending on the animacy of the host nominal: inanimate direct objects are zero-marked while animate direct objects are case marked with the particle -</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >godo</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >. This type of unmarked nominative and marked accusative system is widely attested in Tohoku dialects (some of them employ -</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >godo</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > as an accusative marker). Due to having two types of accusative case marking, the Mitsukaido dialect has an uncoded valency alternation which is not found in Standard Japanese, namely double accusative possessor ascension and (unproductive) double accusative type dative alternation. For the details of double accusative constructions, see Sasaki (2002).<BR>&#9;Another feature distinguishing the Mitsukaido dialect case system from that of Standard Japanese is the degree of elaboratedness of the oblique case particles. The Mitsukaido dialect is more elaborated than Standard Japanese. The semantic sphere of the Standard Japanese dative/locative -</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >ni</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > is divided among four case particles in the Mitsukaido dialect, i.e., locative -</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >ni</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >, dative -</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >nge/-sa</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > (-</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >nge</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > is used for animate goal and -</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >sa</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > is used for inanimate goal), and experiencer case -</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >ngani</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >. The main usage of the experiencer case particle -</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >ngani</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > is a marker for an experiencer oblique subject. The oblique case specific to experiencer is considered to be typologically rare. See Sasaki (2004) and Sasaki (2008b) for details.<BR>&#9;The elaboratedness of the adnominal case particles is also characteristic to this dialect. The Mitsukaido dialect has three adnominal case particles: possessive -</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >nga</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >, genitive -</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >no</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >, and adnominal locative -</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >na</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >.
