2050992691,kore1280,Causative (morphological),"<SPAN STYLE= """" >This form of the causative comprises about nine different suffixes which appear mainly with intransitive and a few transitive verbs. The fact that this type of causative is built through suffixation has led to the present naming and has been applied in numerous sources such as Yeon (2003). O'Grady (1991) refers to this alternation as 'Lexical Causative', although  Sohn (1999: 374) uses this term to refer to inherently causative verbs that are not morphologically derived from retraceable base forms. <BR><BR>The productivity of this alternation seems to be quite reduced in modern Korean, as it can only be applied on a set of about 400-500 Native Korean verbs (O'Grady 1991: 154). Being lexicalised to a great extent, O'Grady (1991: 154) or Yeon (2003: 79) mention that a morphological causative verb form may have a meaning diverging from the verb's base form (see ex. 183, 120 or 155). A couple of morphological causative forms have been given here which have been found in an on-line dictionary, although they had not been known to me prior to this investigation (see ex. 245 or 278). Only transitive and intransitive verbs have morphological causative forms.<BR><BR>As the name suggests, a more or less striking difference between this type of causative and the periphrastic causative is that the latter type is a syntactically analytic construction. <BR><BR>The semantic differences between this type of causative and periphrastic causative constructions have been discussed in numerous publications (see e.g., O'Grady 1991: 154, 172, Sohn 1999: 376 or Yeon 2003: 83ff.). The more 'traditional' conceptualisation is that the causee in a morphological causative construction has little or no agency. Additionally, contrary to the periphrastic causative, this causative implies a direct impact on the thing or person affected by the causer (e.g., in English there is a slight difference between 'John turned the chair around' and 'John made the chair turn around').<BR><BR>As discussed in the comment field of the entry for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >jugda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >, the distinction between what has been labelled as 'distant' and 'contact' causation by Yeon (2003: 83ff.) is by no means that regularly mappable onto the morphological and periphrastic causatives. For example, with verbs such as </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >kkeulhda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'boil' as in ex. 130 the referral to a distance vs. contact-based explanation is rather dissatisfying since the agent (who is typically animate) cannot make water boil in any (physically) 'direct' way. <BR><BR>Additionally, in many cases the periphrastic causative may include the meaning of both 'contact' and 'distant' causation, and in fact for a multiplicity of Korean verbs this is the only option to build a causative construction.<BR><BR>Moreover, what many sources rather tend to neglect is the fact that the construal of an action (and/or its result) may have an impact on the choice of a particular type of causative. It seems that whether one considers the result of an action or the action itself as more relevant to one's concerns - as vague as this intimation may sound to the reader here - can override the actual 'physical' realities of how an action has been carried out, that is, whether some result was caused directly or indirectly. See the comments on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >jugida</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'KILL' for more. <BR><BR>Causativised intransitive verbs have a NOM-ACC case pattern, and causativised transitive verbs have a NOM-DAT-ACC pattern.

As opposed to what has been termed 'morphological causative' here, the causative meaning is expressed by analytic means. Standing in opposition to existing morphological forms which are not realised by multiple syntactic words, this construction can be identified as being periphrastic (see Brown et al. 2012 for more). <BR><BR>Its applicability shows a rather unclear pattern, since it seems to be almost fully productive, whereas on the other hand emotion verbs as </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >johda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'be good', </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >museobda </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >'be scary' do not seem to take part in this alternation, unless these verbs undergo the hada-alternation. Following Yeon (2003:66ff.) on this, in the base form, a Korean emotion verb describes an emotion that is not accessible to external entities, but only to the experiencer, and Yeon concludes that the hada-transitivisation process brings about an 'externalisation' (Yeon 2003: 66) of such emotions. <BR><BR>As mentioned in the entry for the morphological causative, a lot of research has been done on the morphosyntactic and semantic-pragmatic differences of this construction to the periphrastic causative (see entry for the morphological causative for references, or also Lee and Ramsey 2000: 212-215), although research on these differences tend to suffer from a notorious desire to make a clear-cut distinction between these constructions on the one hand, and misconceptions on the nature of periphrastic verb forms on the other. <BR><BR>Especially the Korean periphrastic construction has attracted a great deal of attention regarding the issue of clausality in constructions involving multiple verbs, and various tests have been applied to show that the periphrastic causative involves the embedding of a clause into another that is headed by the auxiliary </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >hada </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >(see Sohn 1999: 377 or Song 2005 for example, or O'Grady 1991: 188ff. making a finer distinction in biclausal and monoclausal periphrastic causative constructions). <BR><BR>The coding pattern in Korean periphrastic causative constructions has been discussed in Yeon (2003: 87) on the basis of Comrie (1981).

For causativised ditransitive verbs Yeon (2003: 88) claims that the causee is encoded in a postpositional phrase, although for someone who is mainly acquainted with spoken Korean I cannot support this claim. Rather I would say that the additional argument here is marked with accusative case.<BR><BR>Yeon (2003: 90ff.) indeed discusses cases that diverge from Comrie's generalisations, and several researchers (cf. O'Grady 1991: 171) have tried to show that the causee can be marked with nominative, dative or accusative case depending on the volitionality and agency that the causee retains. This is a claim that I can neither refute nor confirm, although I would like to remark here that in meany examples I have given here in this database I have noted that nominative and dative marking on the causee sound at best awkward to me. </SPAN>",Coded,"NOM V > NOM-ACC V, NOM-ACC V > NOM-DAT-ACC V, NOM-DAT-ACC V > NOM-ACC-DAT-ACC V",Complex
2051293681,kore1280,Benefactive Alternation,"<SPAN STYLE= """" >The benefactive alternation is a periphrasitically realised (see Brown et al. 2012) valency alternation of the applicative type where a verb's valency is augmented by one. It is generally used in situations where somebody does something for the benefit of someone else, or where someone does something on behalf of someone else (but again, for the benefit of this person). <BR><BR>Following Creissels (2010: 30/31) definition, such a 'benefactive applicative periphrasis' is an applicative alternation that licenses beneficiary roles in particular. As Creissels (2010: 35) further explains, a &quot;benefactive NP is licensed by a word that also occurs with a related meaning in constructions in which it clearly has the status of a verb.&quot;<BR><BR>Indeed, the benefactive periphrasis in Korean is built through a complex predicate that consists of a converb and the verb </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >juda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'give' (and its imperative and honorific counterparts which will not be discussed here, see Sohn 1999: 384ff.), which makes it structurally similar to other auxiliary verb constructions in Korean. In terms of the grammaticalisation of this biverbal construction as a monoclausal construction, Sohn (1999: 384) argues that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >juda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > with its NOM-DAT-ACC coding frame has lost its ability to independently assign semantic roles, although his evidence cannot be regarded as providing the full picture. <BR><BR>The present dataset suggests that only transitive verbs with the coding frame NOM-ACC can undergo this alternation (but this might rather be due to the very narrow understanding of a syntactic benefactive alternation here, see discussion below), resulting in a NOM-DAT-ACC coding frame in the benefactive, and looking at ex. 306 one might assume that the ditransitive case frame alternates with a double accusative case frame. SING might be the only candidate to show that an intransitive verb can undergo this alternation as well, although syntactically it is not sure whether this verb is actually intransitive or not, due to its structural properties (see entry on SING). <BR><BR>When a complex predicate is built using </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >juda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >, three effects can be identified: 1. an overtly dative-marked NP can appear in the clause (COVER, CUT, TIE, POUR, CARRY, SEARCH) 2. an additional NP appears governed by the postposition </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >wihaeseo </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >'for' or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >daesin(haeseo)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'on behalf of' (EAT, WASH, RECEIVE among others) 3. there is no syntactic change, and neither a dative-marked NP nor a postpositional NP can appear. (HUG, WASH (bath) someone, SIT DOWN, HELP and practically all intransitive verbs). The last case is true with ditransitive verbs, and occurs with a lot of causative verbs that are not normally used on their own (see SHOW for example). Curiously however, for a decent number of the verbs in the present data set it seems that such a complex predicate with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >juda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > is highly preferred in spoken usage as oppposed to the 'simple' form, and as a speaker who grew up with spoken Korean only, I have indicated that some verbs sound plain wrong without the verb </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >juda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > (see SHOW (visually) or HELP).<BR><BR>As you can see in the list of verbs, only a handful of verbs allows for an additional, dative-marked NP to appear in the clause when the benefactive alternation is applied. Creissels (2010: 49) discusses Shibatani's (2003: 282-3, see Creissels 2012 for references) idea's regarding an apparently very simialr observation made in Japanese, and argues that &quot;in Japanese, intransitive verbs, or transitive verbs whose object NP denotes an object that is not normally transferred to a beneficiary cannot occur in a BAP [benefactive applicative periphrasis] including an overtly expressed beneficiary&quot;. Shibatani (2003: 282-3, cited in Creissels 2010: 49) specifies this 'transferral' as a &quot;transfer of possessive control&quot; which is not necessarily the same as the transfer of an object.<BR><BR>Looking at the explanation above, one might understand better why even verbs such as TIE or CARRY can undergo a benefactive alternation in Korean, since objects are not transferred per se here, but rather the possessive control over an object. <BR><BR>However, most studies on benefactives in Korean reduce the description to a dichotomy where there are only complex predicate constructions involving </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >juda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > that either allow for an overtly expressed dative NP or not. As mentioned above, an apparently much more frequent possibility is expressing the beneficiary in a postpositional phrase (see ex. 176), or not expressing the beneficiary at all. For the latter case, I have included some examples which have been linked to verbs which have been checked for 'never' regarding this alternation.<BR><BR>Examples such as ex. 349 might be a hint towards a differentiation between a 'semantic' benefactive applicative periphrasis and a 'syntactic' one in terms of the actual correspondence between syntactic exponence and semantic content of an expression. Obviously, I can only 'nudge' to spark some criticism and elucidation here, and would be grateful if the present discussion could lead to research that focuses on this construction alone. The only paper in English that I know of is Shibatani (1994, focusing on semantic valency properties and their comparison between Japanese and Korean), and a much more detailed investigation is desirable. </SPAN>",Coded,NOM-ACC V > NOM-DAT-ACC V+'give',Complex

Moreover, this lexicalisation has brought along apparent passive forms that do not have any active counterparts anymore (see Yeon 2003: 103). <BR><BR>In a passive clause, the accusative-marked NP of a former transitive verb is marked with nominative and is granted subject status.

Among verbs with the coding pattern NOM-ACC, HELP for example cannot undergo mopological passive. Researchers that discuss this alternation do not mention the possibility of arguing that the morphological passive applies to verbs which the argument structure &lt;agent, patient&gt; only, where the patient role implies high affectedness.

In a verbal clause, an argument NP in which the head and the dependent are in a possessor-possessum relationship (optionally indicated by genitive marking on the possessor), the possessum receives the case marking according to the function it fulfills within the subcategorisation of the verb (for example, an NP which is the object of a verb will receive accusative marking).<BR><BR>It is not clear whether one can identify a class of verbs which exhibits this type of coding alternation, although all the discussions in the literature revolve around the specific relationship between the possessor and the possessum within the context of a verbal event. Whereas Yeon (2003: 137) remarks that a possessor ascension construction is only possible when both the possessor and possessum are &quot;regarded as affected by the action&quot; (Yeon 2003: 137), O'Grady states that &quot; 'Possesso ascension' alternations are found in theme NPs naming a whole-part relationship&quot; (O'Grady 1991: 68; although O'Grady himself shows examples where the possessor ascension construction involves NPs that do not seem to be themes, see below), and therefore it remains to be elucidated what could be the common point between all the verbs to which this alternation pertains. <BR><BR>Curiously, there is another possibility than the one mentioned in the first paragraph. With an intransitive verb, both constituents of an original possessor-possessum NP in subject function can be marked with nominative case (ex. 316, 184), or with a transitive verb, both constituents of an original possessor-possessum NP in object function can be marked with accusative case (ex. 253). Interestingly, for a transitive verb, this way of alternative encoding seems to possible only for the object NP, and not for the subject NP. Moreover, this alternative way of marking for object NPs does not seem to be possible for accusative NPs of verbs with NOM-DAT-ACC pattern. Also, intransitive verbs which have a NOM-NOM case pattern (which in turn is said to alternate with DAT-NOM, see entry for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >jota</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'LIKE' and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >museobda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'FEAR') do not seem to allow for this alternation where one would have a coding pattern with three overtly nominative-marked NPs. <BR><BR>O'Grady (1991: 72) gives a highly unnatural and questionable example (ex. 315) to argue that in a possessor ascension construction the bearer of the theme/patient role changes from the former possessum to the possessor, and accordingly (hence the term 'ascension'), only the possessor in a possessor ascension construction can become the subject of a corresponding passive construction. Note therefore the (from a Indoeuropean perspective) rather strange coding pattern with NOM-postpos_adjunct-ACC V, which I would reject categorically, although being discussed by several scholars regardless of whether these constructions are actually poduced in speech (cf. Yeon 2003: 179).<BR><BR>A further observation in this construction is that in a possessor ascension construction as in ex. 170 the possessum NP cannot take on a modifier to its left (for example, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >dukkeoun</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > thick.ATTR) which would actually be possible in a 'non-ascended' construction. O'Grady (1991: 75) mentions that accordingly, the possessum NP underlies restrictions in terms of its referential specificity here, and more curiously, he discusses the possibility (following Choi 1988: 62, see O'Grady 74 for references) that the second accusative-marked NP in a possessor ascension construction undergoes a categorical change to an adverbial NP, which therefore cannot take on adnominal modifiers as </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >dukkeoun </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >above. <BR><BR>This proposal surely is interesting given the fact that the 'adverbial' status (alhough using this term in a more semantically oriented way) of an accusative-marked NP has been discussed elsewhere in this database (see way/number alternation), although as discussed in the next paragraph below, I am not sure how this adverbial status of an NP and its accusative-marking could be considered in conjunction with the fact that in passive clauses it changes to nominative case. Whatever the case though, a more obvious fact has not been mentioned in the literature, namely the observation that in a possessor ascension construction, the two NPs with identical marking may not be scrambled around, but the original possessor-possessum order has to be maintained. In this light, it is interesting that this Korean  does not seem to have been discussed within the possibility of exhibiting Suffixaufnahme (Plank 1995), and maybe this is a way to look a this construction.<BR><BR>As opposed to examples such as ex. 315 I would intuitively say that in a passive clause the two accusative-marked arguments in a possessor ascension construction change to nominative-marked arguments, similarly to the 'recipient double accusative alternation' described here (ex. 287). Arguably this raises the question of how syntactic theories could capture this alternation, and O'Grady (1991: 134ff.) proposes as regarding the former (optionally genitive-marked) possessor NP as sort of a focus NP that has been added at the left edge of a simple passive clause of which the possessum is the subject, a view that I can neither reject nor support here due to a lack of sufficient knowledge of the the theory proposed by O'Grady (1991). </SPAN>",Uncoded,X-NOM Z-NOM V > X-GEN Z-NOM V ; Z-NOM X-ACC Y-ACC V > X-GEN Y-ACC V,

The accusative-marked NP that is not accusative-marked in the alternative pattern seems to have a different status from one double accusative construction to another which is why they are treated differently here. <BR><BR>This alternation has been reported for ditransitive verbs with the coding pattern NOM-DAT-ACC including benefactive complex predicates with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >juda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >, where the recipient/beneficiary<BR>argument can be alternatively marked with an accusative case marker. Whereas in the NOM-DAT-ACC coding pattern the dative argument could follow the accusative argument - for example, whenever the dative-marked argument stands in preverbal focus position and not the accusative-marked argument - in the NOM-ACC-ACC coding pattern the word order seems to become stricter, with the accusative-marked recipient NP preceding the accusative-marked theme argument. It has been reported that in elicitation sessions some consultatns may reject this coding pattern as ungrammatical, and some other may acknowledge their existence, while at the same time remarking that it somehow sounds awkward (see O'Grady 1991: 53, for example, where this alternation is called 'dative advancement'). I assume that most of the time, this must be due to the lack of context in single-sentence elicitation and grammaticality checks, since I myself find this construction awkward sometimes although I am sure that I am using it frequently. Curiously enough - given the fact that having overt case marking (and overt NPs!) in every sentence in Korean seems unnatural - it has not been studied whether these mixed results from elicitation could be due to the fact that Korean case markers may bear some information-structural functions.<BR><BR>The interaction with Korean case marking, case marking alternations and information structure has not been researched extensively, and it could be very interesting to look at whether the positional or prosodic information structure functions such as specific focus intonations or focus positions are still applicable in alternative coding patterns such as this double accusative construction.<BR><BR>When a verb with a double accusative coding pattern is passivised, then this may result in a double-nominative coding pattern with the corresponding passive verb, as in ex. 314.

The most unproblematic case for illustration might be where a verb has both the possibility to undergo morphological and periphrastic passive alternation.<BR><BR>Ex. 158 shows the morphological passive form of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >nohda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" >, where the event of being put somewhere seems to have happened spontaneously (at least seen from the speaker's perspective), and more importantly, it is assumed that the agent is unknown, and the existence of that agent is not even presupposed. As a conseuquence, and agent cannot be expressed here. <BR><BR>Ex. 157 by contrast shows a sentence with a periphrastic passive, where it is implied that a feeling cannot be put away (translated here with an active sentence) even if one wanted to, and therefore one can conclude that the periphrastic passive tends to retain some volitionality and agency with regard to the instantiation of an event. As opposed to a sentence with a morphological passive, some unknown agent seems to be implied in a periphrastic passive construction (see cf. 94, 233), and this is how some researchers such as O'Grady (1991: 49) call such a verb a 'middle verb' (although this term has been applied to a morphological passive form), and this degree of retained agency seems to correlate with retained control of the agent over the patient.<BR><BR>Accordingly, Yeon (2003: 120ff.) states that in Korean there are verbs which describe weather, nature or perception events (see HEAR or SEE in this database) that undergo morphological passivisation, whereas these verbs cannot be inflected for a periphrastic passive, which Yeon takes as evidence to say that periphrastic passives can only be applied when some control over the patient can be maintained. <BR><BR>As you can see, many examples for this type of passive have been translated into English with an active, modal counterpart, and this is maybe how I tried to express the volitionality that is implied in most of the periphrastic passive sentences. Interestingly, other Koreanic languages such as Jeju for example have developed constructions similar to this periphrastic passive in Korean where the auxiliary </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >ji</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > is used to express deontic modality: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >al-a ji-keu-nya</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > know-CONV AUX-IRR-Q means 'You think you can understand this?' in Jeju (see Kang 2007 for a little overview). <BR><BR>Unfortunately, literature on Korean tends to generalise too much on the differences between the morphological and periphrastic passive, and it could well be that in spoken language both versions are used interchangeably, with the periphrasticpassive  slowly  supplanting morphological forms. As an example, ex. 247 shows the periphrastic passive form of  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >jjijda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'TEAR', and it is little convincing here to argue for volitionality and agency in terms of the event of shoes getting torn.<BR><BR>Still, this might be due to the fact that arguably, when a verb can employ only one passive variant, then it is probable that one and the same construction can exhibit the semantic differences from above depending on the context (see ex. 218 where the periphrastic passive does not imply an agent). In fact, for the verb TEAR I was not really aware of the fact that there was a morphological passive form of TEAR, and this might have fostered my usage of a periphrastic passive form which includes that for agentless passives. Therefore, frequency in usage should be considered when looking at the differences between these two variants, and a corpus-based approach is still pending. <BR><BR>As another argument that should be seen as a warning from being too over-generalising is the fact that for some verbs such as </SPAN><SPAN STYLE= ""font-style:italic;"" >deopda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE= """" > 'COVER' it is indeed quite difficult to argue for a semantic difference between the two morphosyntactically  different types of passive. <BR><BR>Yeon (2003: 123) suggests that the expressibility of an overt agent phrase in a sentence depends on the verbal semantics of a passive verb. Agents in some passive sentences in Korean can either be marked with dative (animate nouns), locative (inanimate nouns) or a postpositional phrase (see entry for morphological passive for more). He distinguishes between resultative and processive passives, where the former depicts a situation where the result of an action is salient (allowing for no agent or only a 'natural force', inanimate agen), whereas the latter a situation where the process (albeit being a vague notion, see ex. 152) of an event is salient. </SPAN>",Coded,NOM V > V; NOM-ACC V > NOM V; NOM-DAT-ACC V > NOM-DAT V; NOM-ACC-ACC V > NOM-NOM V,Complex
